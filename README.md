The Bryan processor adopts a sequential two-stage pipeline structure, namely the instruction fetch (IF) and the integrated stage (ID+EX+MEM+WB) that includes instruction decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back functions. 
It covers RV32I (Basic Integer Instruction Set), RV32E (Embedded Instruction Set), RV32M (Multiplication and Division Instruction Set), and RV32Zicsr (Control and Status Register Instruction Set), and only supports machine mode. 
Equipped with a vector interrupt system and using a programmable interrupt controller (PLIC) to manage external interrupts. 
Adopting the Harvard architecture, it separates the instruction access and data memory access paths, and also provides a complete SoC implementation solution, including the ICB bus architecture and common peripherals.
